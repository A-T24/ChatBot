💬 My ChatterBox: Data Science & ML Chatbot






🚀 Project Overview

My ChatterBox is a sleek, web-based chatbot built with Python, Dash, and machine learning. It answers questions about Data Science, Machine Learning, and related tools like Python, Pandas, SQL, and algorithms.

It uses Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization to map user queries to structured answers from a custom knowledge base.

✨ Key Idea: Train the bot on a dataset of Q&A pairs to provide instant responses in a visually appealing chat interface.

🛠 Features

📝 Custom Knowledge Base – Trainable dataset (chatbot_dataset.csv) with FAQs.

🧠 NLP Backend – Uses nltk for tokenization and TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction.

🌙 Dark Mode UI – Modern, responsive interface built with Dash.

💬 Interactive Chat – Real-time messages with styled chat bubbles.

⚡ Lightweight & Extendable – Easily add new Q&A pairs to expand intelligence.
